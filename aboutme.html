        <h1>My Journey</h1>

        <p>
            My passion for coding first ignited in 2nd grade when I joined a coding club and began using Scratch block coding. This early, hands-on experience in problem solving was later solidified by taking an 'Introduction to Python' class as a freshman in high school, which guided my academic path to The Ohio State University for Computer Science and Engineering.
